# Person-re-Identification-with-Deep-Learning

This repository contains a deep learning project focused on **Person Re-Identification (ReID)** using the [Market-1501 dataset](https://github.com/zhunzhong07/Market-1501). The goal is to build a system that can recognize and match identities of people across multiple camera views using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and PyTorch.
