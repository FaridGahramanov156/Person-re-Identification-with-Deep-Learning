# Person-re-Identification-with-Deep-Learning

This repository contains a deep learning project focused on **Person Re-Identification (ReID)** using the [Market-1501 dataset](https://github.com/zhunzhong07/Market-1501). The goal is to build a system that can recognize and match identities of people across multiple camera views using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and PyTorch.

## ðŸ§  Methodology

### ðŸ§© Triplet Loss Function

This project uses the **Triplet Loss** function to train a model that minimizes the distance between embeddings of the **same person** and maximizes it for **different persons**.

- **Anchor** â€“ an image of a person
- **Positive** â€“ another image of the same person
- **Negative** â€“ an image of a different person

The network learns to satisfy:
\[
\|f(a) - f(p)\|^2 + \text{margin} < \|f(a) - f(n)\|^2
\]

Where:
- \(f(.)\) is the embedding function (usually a CNN)
- margin is a constant (e.g., 0.3)
